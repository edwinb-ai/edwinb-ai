## Edwin :computer:

BSc. in Physics. Currently doing a MSc. to attempt to apply Machine Learning to Colloidal Soft Matter systems.

Here are some of my interests:

- Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing.
- Soft Matter Physics and its computational component.
- Optimization and metaheuristics (still learning).
- Programming languages (just for fun).
- An aficionado of DevOps. I like to use containers, CI and everything in between to make scientific software more robust and reusable.

Some of the programming languages that I can work with:

- Julia (my favorite)
- Python
- Fortran
- R
- C/C++

Checkout some of the projects I have done with these languages.
