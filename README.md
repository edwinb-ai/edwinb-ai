## Edwin :computer:

BSc. in Physics. Currently doing a MSc. to unify Colloidal Soft Matter and Machine Learning.

Here are some of my interests:

- Numerical methods
- Soft Matter Physics
- Computer Simulations
- Statistical Machine Learning (Bayesian formulation and probabilistic models)
- Programming languages (just for fun)
