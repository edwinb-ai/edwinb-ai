BSc. in Physics. Currently doing a MSc. to unify Colloidal Soft Matter and Machine Learning.

Here are some of my interests:

- Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing
- Soft Matter Physics and its computational component
- Optimization and metaheuristics (still learning)
- Programming languages (just for fun)
